 * Chain , composiciÃ³n!!! lesgo
 *
 * A value that implements the Chain specification must also implement the Apply specification.
 *
 * m.chain(f).chain(g) is equivalent to m.chain(x => f(x).chain(g)) (associativity)
 *
 * chain method:
 *
 * chain :: Chain m => m a ~> (a -> m b) -> m b
 * A value which has a Chain must provide a chain method. The chain method takes one argument:
 *
 * m.chain(f)
 * 1. f must be a function which returns a value
 *   1.1 If f is not a function, the behaviour of chain is unspecified.
 *   1.2 f must return a value of the same Chain
 * 2. chain must return a value of the same Chain
